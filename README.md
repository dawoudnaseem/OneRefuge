# OneRefuge

## Helping refugees navigate new beginnings

Seeking asylum in an unfamiliar world is far more complex and arduous than privileged individuals could ever anticipate. 
Refugees are tasked with familiarizing themselves to foreign languages, acclimating to unfamiliar policies, finding the 
right support centres, and a variety of other considerations. 

Driven by the intent to address this humanitarian issue and to reduce the strain on overwhelmed aid organizations and systems,
we've created OneRefuge, a digital platform that aims to provide immediate and accurate answers to point refugees in the right 
direction, while empowering them and insuring their dignity in their new lives. It acts as an aggregator of information to support 
refugees settling in Canada such as:

* Healthcare 
* Legalities
* Food Services
* Housing
* Communities
* Job Opportunities
* Services (ex: Language Aquisition)
