        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Accessing healthcare is an important part of settling into a new environment. As a refugee, you may face unique challenges, but there are systems and organizations ready to support you. This guide provides information to help you navigate healthcare opportunities, with a focus on resources in Canada.</p>

        <h2>General Resources for Refugees</h2>
        <p>Your well-being is a priority. Below are some key resources to ensure you can access the care you need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emergency Medical Services:</strong> In case of a medical emergency, you can call <strong>911</strong> for immediate assistance. Emergency care is available to everyone in Canada.</li>
            <li><strong>Free Clinics:</strong> Many organizations, such as <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org">Doctors Without Borders</a> and <a href="https://www.redcross.ca">Red Cross</a>, offer free or low-cost clinics to provide essential medical care.</li>
            <li><strong>Mental Health Support:</strong> If you are feeling overwhelmed, know that mental health services are available. The <a href="https://www.rescue.org">International Rescue Committee (IRC)</a> and local organizations provide counseling and support for refugees.</li>
            <li><strong>Vaccination Services:</strong> Staying up-to-date with vaccinations is important. Many clinics and community health centers offer free immunization services to protect your health.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Healthcare in Canada</h2>
        <p>Canada has a strong healthcare system that includes specific programs for refugees. Here are some key highlights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP):</strong> This program provides temporary health coverage, including medical care, prescriptions, and dental services, for refugees and asylum seekers. It acts as a bridge until you qualify for provincial or territorial health plans.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Health Centers:</strong> These centers provide a range of services, including primary care, mental health counseling, and nutritional advice, often at no cost or very low cost.</li>
            <li><strong>Provincial Health Coverage:</strong> Once you gain refugee status, you can register for healthcare coverage in your province, such as OHIP in Ontario or MSP in British Columbia.</li>
            <li><strong>Womenâ€™s Health Services:</strong> Specialized services are available to support women, including prenatal care and family planning, through community health programs.</li>
        </ul>
